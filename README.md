This is just something I'm working on for fun. I initially wanted to make my own program to download videos from youtube and extract the audio from them
but turns out youtube has made that wildly complicated to do. So, this is more or less going to be my own little wrapper for youtube-dlp. At the moment, here's how it works:

arg 1 will be the http address of the youtube video you want audio from

arg 2 will be your desired file name

for example:

ytmp3 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfLszg_L1aQ' 'bratva'

I have plans to make it do more. Reaper integration sounds like a fun and useful challenge, for instance. But for now, it's super basic
